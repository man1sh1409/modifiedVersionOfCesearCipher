# Modified Version of Ceaser cipher
. it strengths the substitution/shift ceaser cipher.
algorithm :
break key into two subkeys
use one key for generating hashmap table
other is used for encryption and decryption.
it also does 2 time column tranposition with second key.
that make it more diffcult to break.

# all functions of encyption ,key generation ,decrption are written in this module.
